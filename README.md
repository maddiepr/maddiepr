# Madeline (Maddie) Preston

Hi, I'm Maddie Preston - a computational scientist and applied mathematican who loves turning mathematical models into real, working code. I specialize in high-performance simulations, numerical solvers, and backend tools for scientific and engineering problems.

Right now, I'm focused on:
- Simulating PDEs with Monte Carlo methods
- Writing efficient solvers in Python, C++, and Fortran
- Building reproducible workflows with Docker and SQL
- Exploring backend APIs and data systems for simulation output

My work spans scientific computing, machine learning, and infrastructure. I'm always looking for ways to bridge theory and practice clean, scalable code.
