# 👋 Hi, I’m Maddie Preston

💻 I'm a Master's student in Applied Mathematics at UNC Chapel Hill, where I focus on fluid dynamics, PDEs, and high-performance simulation.

🎲 I build mathematical software using Python and Fortran, including Monte Carlo-based PDE solvers in complex domains.

🛠️ I’m passionate about turning complex math into efficient code and look forward to applying these skills in industry.

## 🔧 Tools & Languages
Python • Fortran • HPC • NumPy • Git • Jupyter
